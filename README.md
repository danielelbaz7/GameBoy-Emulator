A Game Boy emulator built by Daniel Elbaz and Jackson Johannesson.

Implements all 500 opcodes, a scanline-rendering-based PPU, the entire memory addressing system including all of MBC1 and MBC3 (without the real-time clock). It also implements all timers, all interrupts, and the ability to use your keyboard to play games! The input system maps the following keys to the following buttons:

- W -> Up
- A -> Left
- S -> Down
- D -> Right
- Z -> A Button
- X -> B button
- C -> Start
- V -> Select

(WIP) The Game Boy also features a GUI with keybind customization, custom color palettes, and a simple to use interface for ROM loading.
